This R script contains the instructions for scraping the web for rosters and compiling a list of all team rosters over all years and is found in the script
'create-historical-roster.R'. This script generates a file called 'complete-roster-info.csv'. 

From the complete roster, the script 'longest-tenured-college-on-each-team.R' can be run which determines the longest tenured college for each NFL team
from the 'complete-roster-info.csv' file. The information is saved to a csv file, 'team-college-nice.csv'.
